### How to run this app:

#### 1) Download the source code from the github repository.

#### 2) Enter to the backend folder and run this command "npm run dev". Then you will see the server is ready. If you dont have db file, first run "npm run setup" and this will create dev.db file in project folder.

#### 3)Enter to the front end folder and run this command "npm start". Then you can see the app is running on your browser. Or you can type the "localhost:3000" on browser url input.

### About this app:

#### I used sqlite for database and prisma to operate with database as sqlite is suitable for small and test project. In the production mode, it is preferred to use another database. (MongoDB is good if nodejs is used.) For backend, I used nodejs and express.js. For front end, I used React. There are some features to add such as pagination in case of many data and so forth. But I hope this can be used to judge my skills.
